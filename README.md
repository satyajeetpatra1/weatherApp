# Weather App

* Created a fully responsive weather app.

* Created with the use of HTML | CSS | Tailwind | JS.

* Use of version control system (Git & GitHub).

* Integrated with API (openweather) to get the current weather report and 5 days forecast also.

* Can search weather report by simply entering the city name or just by clicking  "Use Current Location" (need to allow location service for using this feature).

* Recently searched city names are automatically added in the dropdown menu for easy access of recently searched city.

* Input validation also implemented.

* Toggle unit feature between Celcius and Farenhite also added.

* Extended forecast display feature added - collapsed by default, can be extended or collapsed on a simple button click.

* All the errors, informations and alerts are shown by visual text on ui not by using JS alert method.

* Everything is documented properly in both HTML and JS.
